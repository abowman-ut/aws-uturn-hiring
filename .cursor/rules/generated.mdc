# Style Guide

## Visual Design Principles

- Use icons to enhance visual hierarchy and improve UX
  - Primary icons should use the brand blue (#4361ee)
  - Use filled icons for better visibility
  - Icons should be contained in styled containers when representing status
  - Include loading state icons for better UX

- Color Usage
  - Primary brand color: #4361ee (blue)
  - Success states: #059669 (green) with #ecfdf5 background
  - Error states: #dc2626 (red) with #fef2f2 background
  - Text colors:
    - Headers: #1e293b (slate-900)
    - Body: #64748b (slate-500)
  - Use subtle borders (#e2e8f0) for separation

- Component Design
  - Cards should have 12px border radius
  - Use subtle shadows (0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05))
  - Include hover states and transitions (0.2s ease)
  - Status indicators should be clearly visible with icon + text
  - Group related elements with consistent spacing (0.5rem, 0.75rem, 1rem, 1.5rem)

- Typography
  - Headers: 1.75rem for h1, 1.25rem for h2
  - Body text: 0.875rem with 1.5 line height
  - Use font weights strategically (600 for main headers, 500 for sub-headers)
  - Capitalize status text for emphasis

- Mobile Considerations
  - Reduce padding and margins by ~25% on mobile
  - Adjust icon sizes for touch targets (minimum 2rem)
  - Maintain text readability with consistent font sizes
  - Stack elements vertically when appropriate
