# Preferences


- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested of you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point
