# Preferences


- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point

- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod

- Only make changes that are requested of you 
- Changes should be well understood, if you are not confident ask me to clarify
